# Chemotherapy Modulation by a Cancer-Associated Microbiota Metabolite

In this repository, we provide the code and data used in the manuscript "Chemotherapy Modulation by a Cancer-Associated Microbiota Metabolite" by **Daniel Martinez-Martinez, Tanara V. Peres _et al._**

## Abstract

Coming soon...

## Data

The data used in this study is available in the `data` folder. The data is organized as follows:

**KEGGEcoCycClass.csv**: List of KEGG and EcoCyc pathways and their corresponding classes for the nutrients in the Biolog plates.

**ecocyc_paths.csv**: List of pathways from the EcoCyc database.

## Code

The code used in this study is available in the `code` folder. The code is organized as follows:

**4_way_plots.R**: R script to generate the 4-way plots in Figure 2 and S2.

**gene_nutrient_screen.R**: R script to generate the gene-nutrient screen in Figure 3 and S3. Double mutant plot in Figure S4. 

**micit_producers.R**: R script to generate the micit production in the different cohorts in Figure 5 and S5. 

**cancer_cell_viability.R**: R script to generate the cancer cell viability in Figure 5 and cell growth in Figure S5.

NOTE: Figures may not look as in the final version as those were further edited in Adobe Illustrator for publication purposes. The code is provided as is, and may require additional dependencies to run.
